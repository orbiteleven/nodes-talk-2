# Express Yourself with Node.js

A talk for ABQ Web Geeks on building a web application using Node.js Express.js.

The "chapters" below correspond (roughly) to branches of this application.

## 01-hello-world: Getting to "Hello World"

Initial bootstrap of Node.js, creating a server, and returning "Hello World".

## 02-expressjs: "Hello World", but now with Express.js

Since "raw" Node.js can be a bit verbose we implement "Hello World" in Express.js, a web application framework.
